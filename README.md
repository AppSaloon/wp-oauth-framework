# wp-oauth-framework
WordPress OAuth Framework to enable login with popular services

Don't forget to do ```composer install``` when you install this plugin.

This plugin doesn't support any OAuth service out of the box, it is meant as a base on which you can expand using
WordPress actions and filters.
